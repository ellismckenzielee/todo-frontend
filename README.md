# Todo Frontend

This is a simple frontend for a backend API I created that utilises Svelte. I wanted to get some experience with a front-end framework that wasn't react (since all my previous projects have used react), and see if I could implement material UI.

## Technologies

```
+ Svelte
+ Material UI
+ Axios
```

## Functionality

Basic to do list functionality:

```
1. GET: Retrieve all todos from the database.
2. POST: Create a new todo and store it in the database.
3. DELETE: Remove a todo from the front and backend.
4. PUT: Toggle the complete property of a todo, on both the front and backend.
```
